        <li>2 tsp mixed powder</li>
        <li>About 250ml (1 cup) homemade vegetable stock or spice stock - enough to cover</li>

        <li>3 tbsp finely chopped coriander (cilantro)</li>
        <li>125g (1 cup) frozen peas Salt, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instruction</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the vegetable filling, heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat until bubbles appear.</li>
        <li>Add the cumin seeds. When they become fragrant in the oil, toss in the onion and chillies, and fry for5-7 minutes until the onion is translucent and lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic and ginger paste and fry for a further minute. Add the potatoes and mixed powder, and just enough water or spice stock to cover.</li>
        <li>Simmer until the potatoes are soft, topping up the stock if needed. Add the carrot and continue cooking until cooked through but still al dente.</li>
        <li>Reduce the stock until you have a dry potato mixture. Stir in the coriander (cilantro) and peas and season with salt. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Fold the samosas as photographed above.</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, pour 10cm (4in) of rapeseed (canola) oil into a deep saucepan and heat to 170°C (340°F). Fry the samosas in batches until nicely browned.</li>
        <li>Remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a wire rack. Keep warm while you fry the remaining samosas.</li>
    </ol>
